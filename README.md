## My process

So, this is the second time I'm doing a challenge to build a website. I built this website with a mobile-first strategy and with Flexbox for alignment. The hard part for me is making this website responsive because I'm still learning how to make a responsive website properly, so watching Kevin Powell's video on Youtube helped me so much for this project. Feel free to give your feedback and suggestion. Thank you.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
